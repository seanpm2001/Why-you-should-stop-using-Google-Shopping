Google shopping was launched as `Froogle` back on 2002, December 12th. It is an included feature in the Google search engine that allows linking to online shopping. As it is a Google product, it contains privacy issues, and as part of the Google search engine, AMP integration is mandatory, and privacy is illegal here.

It isn't that hard to alternate from.

**This section needs lots of work**
